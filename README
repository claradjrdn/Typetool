Generative Typeface Editor

depedencies : 
	- bower
	- opentype.js

structure : 
	- /css/ (css files...)
	- /dist/ (js libraries)
	- /fonts/ (default fonts for the editor)
	- /src/ (javascript files)
	- home.html (run the program)


==========================

Typetool is an experimental project of generative typefaces based on the opentype.js library. You will find here the original code of the GENERATIVE TYPEFACE EDITOR that I made. I focused my work on two sides : 

---- the technical side (the structure of my javascript code: make it maintanable, readable and as clean as possible)
---- the artistic side (the way that we can play with the typefaces and create original, beautiful and kind of weird visuals)

==========================


So I invite you to look at my SRC FOLDER which contain the most interesting part of the project. I also invite you to visit my tumblr codemytype.tumblr.com. It's a kind of work in progress gallery, you will find all the differents funny/beautiful/interesting visuals that I made deliberately or not (mistake can be pretty) with this tool during the creation of it.
You will also be able to live test the editor on my portfolio soon : claradujardin.fr
